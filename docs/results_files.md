# Result files
Hastings produces a lot of intermediate and result files but only files defined in [`output_files.json`](https://github.com/clinical-genomics-uppsala/hastings_rd_wes/blob/main/config/output_list.json) are kept, the rest are temporary and will be deleted when not needed by any other rules in the pipeline. Please use the `--no-temp` snakemake option when running the pipeline to retain all files generated by the pipeline, or edit the output_files.json to retain a retain the files required.


## Files
Successful execution of the pipeline result in the the following output files located in `Results/`-folder:

| File | Format |Description |
|---|---|---|
multiqc_DNA.html| html  | Aggregated QC values for entire sequence run, open in browser|
{sample}/{sample}_N.cram | cram | Sorted and deduplicated CRAM alignement file |
{sample}/{sample}_N.cram.crai | crai |  Index for the CRAM alignment file | 
{sample}/spring/{sample}_{type}_{flowcell}_{lane}_{barcode}.spring| spring (.tar archives) | Spring compressed files (lossless) are tar archives of the raw fastq files (.fastq.gz files)|
{sample}/{sample}_snv_indels.vcf.gz | vcf.gz | Compressed deepvariant VCF file  |
{sample}/{sample}_snv_indels.vcf.gz.tbi | tbi | Index for the compressed deepvariant VCF file  |
{sample}/{sample}_exomedepth.aed | aed | Exome depth calls in aed format |
{sample}/{sample}_exomedepth_SV.txt | txt | Exome depth calls |
{sample}/{sample}.upd_regions.bed | bed | Bed file of UPD regions called from a Trio VCF. Sample in this case is the sample id of the proband in the trio.  |
{sample}/{sample}.coverage_analysis.xlsx | excel  | Excel file summarising the depth of covearage in genes in various gene panels |
{sample}/automap/{sample}.HomRegions.tsv | tsv |  Regions of homozygosity  detected by AutoMap |
{sample}/automap/{sample}.HomRegions.pdf | pdf  | Visualisation of ROH regions detected by AutoMap |
{sample}/peddy/peddy.html | html  | Peddy results visualised to be open in browser |


## MultiQC report
Hastings produces a **[MultiQC](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC)**-report for the entire sequencing run to enable easier QC tracking. The report starts with a general statistics table showing the most important QC-values followed by additional QC data and diagrams. The entire MultiQC html-file is interactive and you can filter, highlight, hide or export data using the ToolBox at the right edge of the report.

<br />

The report is configured based on a MultiQC config file.

```yaml
{% include "includes/multiqc_config.yaml" %}
```

The report contain qc information derived from the following programs:



### General Statistics
The general statistics table are ordered based on the sample order in Illumina `SampleSheet.csv` file used during sequencing, this is done by renaming the samples in two steps using the script `extract_samples_info.py`. To toggle between "Sample Order" and "Sample Name" use the buttons just above General Stats header.
